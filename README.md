# Life XP Dashboard

Personal analytics for life optimization (sleep, mood, productivity)

## Scope and Direction
- Project path: `_fixme/life-xp-dashboard`
- Primary tech profile: Elixir, Node.js/TypeScript or JavaScript
- Audit date: `2026-02-08`

## What Appears Implemented
- Detected major components: `src/`
- No clear API/controller routing signals were detected at this scope
- Root `package.json` defines development/build automation scripts

## API Endpoints
- No explicit HTTP endpoint definitions were detected at the project root scope

## Testing Status
- `test` script available in root `package.json`
- `test:run` script available in root `package.json`
- `test:ui` script available in root `package.json`
- `test:coverage` script available in root `package.json`
- `mix test` likely applies for Elixir components
- This audit did not assume tests are passing unless explicitly re-run and captured in this session

## Operational Assessment
- Estimated operational coverage: **37%**
- Confidence level: **medium**

## Bucket Rationale
- This project sits in `_fixme`, indicating known functional or integration issues still need correction before it should be treated as stable.

## Future Work
- Document and stabilize the external interface (CLI, API, or protocol) with explicit examples
- Run the detected tests in CI and track flakiness, duration, and coverage
- Validate runtime claims in this README against current behavior and deployment configuration
- Prioritize defect triage and integration repairs before introducing major new feature scope
