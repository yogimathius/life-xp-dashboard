```

## Current Status

- CRA-based frontend scaffold with concept framing.
- No evidence of a working data pipeline or backend integration.
- Operational estimate: **25%** (concept + scaffold).

## Fixme Rationale

- Marked `_fixme` likely because the app is a scaffold without core functionality wired in.

## API Endpoints

- None documented.

## Tests

- Test script exists, but not run in this audit.

## Future Work

- Implement data ingestion and analytics.
- Add dashboards and persistence.
- Introduce test coverage for critical UI flows.
